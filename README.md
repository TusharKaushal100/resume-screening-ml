# Resume Screening using Logistic Regression

This project implements a simple machine learning model to classify resumes
as shortlisted or not shortlisted based on structured resume features.

## Overview
- Uses Logistic Regression as a baseline classifier
- Converts resume attributes into numerical features
- Generates a binary hire label based on AI score threshold
- Evaluates model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Stratified K-Fold cross-validation
- Model evaluation with visualizations

## Note
This project is intended as a learning-focused ML baseline model and
not a production hiring system.
